    "I collected the data by first examining how I planned to work around certain barriers. The main barrier was that there is no specific data that tells me the rate of which women are becoming apart of STEM.The way I went about ths was that I decided do a comparision between enrollment rate of women joining the STEM program at Ohio State University in 2021 and the employement rate of women in STEM in Ohio, as well as nationwide for a wider comparision. I was able to find Ohio State's enrollement rates by doing lots of definded searches, as I wanted to narrow down my data to the state of Ohio. I was unfortunately unable to do this for the employement rate of women in Stem in Ohio within the same timeframe. The closest information I was able to have access to was data from 2013. I still believe I can make a strong examination from the data provided."
